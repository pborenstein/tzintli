S: You are an expert on 20th century culture.
U: Write a treatment for a series about Sally Draper from MadMen as a young woman in her 20s
A: Title: Sally Draper: Growing Up Modern

Logline: In the 1970s, Sally Draper navigates adulthood in a changing world in New York City, using the lessons she learned from her tumultuous upbringing to find her way in a rapidly evolving society.

Synopsis: 

Sally Draper, now in her early 20s, is living in New York City in the 1970s. After her experiences with the tumultuous culture of the 1960s, Sally is determined to make her mark in the modern world. She starts her journey living with a group of college friends in an apartment in the East Village.

As Sally enters the workforce, she realizes that the opportunities are different than they were for her parentsâ€™ generation. Sally takes an entry-level job in advertising, but quickly realizes that she wants to pursue her own creative interests.

Sally reconnects with her father, Don Draper, who is now a successful ad executive, and learns more about the industry. She starts to take on freelance work and eventually launches her own agency, utilizing the insights she has gained from working in an industry that was dominated by men.

Throughout the series, Sally also navigates relationships with friends and romantic partners, all while struggling to come to terms with her past and move forward as a strong, independent woman.

Ultimately, Sally finds success on her own terms, using the values she learned from her upbringing to navigate a rapidly changing world.

Target Audience: The target audience for this show would be fans of Mad Men who are interested in seeing how Sally grows up and navigates adulthood in the 1970s.

U: Write it again, but in a more cynical voice. Don't look for rainbows.
A: Title: Sally Draper: Same 'Ol Misery in Modern Times

Logline: It's the 1970s, and Sally Draper is still struggling to find her way in a world that hasn't changed as much as she'd hoped. Despite her determination to make it in New York City, Sally is facing the same issues as the generation before her - sexism in the workplace, unfulfilling relationships, and the ghosts of her troubled past.

Synopsis: 

Sally Draper, now in her 'glamorous' 20s, is still trying to figure out how to make her mark in the world. She's living in a cramped East Village apartment with her college friends and barely scraping by on her entry-level advertising job.

Despite her Ivy League education, Sally is facing the same old challenges that her mother faced decades earlier. She's constantly belittled and underestimated in the workplace, struggling to get ahead in an industry dominated by men.

After reconnecting with her father Don, Sally sees a glimmer of hope in the advertising world. But as she starts taking on freelance work, Sally discovers that even in the creative industry, women are expected to be subservient to the male decision-makers.

Sally's dabbles in romantic relationships are equally dismal, with partners who are self-absorbed and selfish. As she tries desperately to find love and connection, Sally still grapples with the emotional turmoil of her childhood, haunted by the memories of her parents' troubled marriage and her own turbulent adolescence.

Through it all, Sally tries to find a sense of purpose and fulfillment, but the world seems designed to thwart her at every turn. In the end, she is left wondering if anything has actually changed in the decades since her parents' generation fought for social progress and equality.

Target Audience: This series would appeal to viewers who are looking for a gritty, unvarnished portrayal of life for women in the 1970s. It would also appeal to fans of Mad Men who want to see a continuation of Sally Draper's story, complete with all the disappointment and disillusionment that comes with growing up in a society that promises progress but delivers more of the same old misery.
